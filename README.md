## Background

This project is part of my final year project for a BSc Computer Science.
I plan to use GitHub issues as an aid to project management with Milestones marking sprints and issues which represent
issues (in agile terms).
Alongside this I will also have an issue label to keep track of the project Diary, a requirement of the project.
By keeping a diary of each commit I can reference what code I was working on that day and will be using GitHub Gist's
for keeping track of Unit tests.
